            In my freshman year of college I took a Film and Media Studies introductory course. I’ve always liked movies, but I wanted to understand what, in the most objective sense, makes a movie ‘good’ or ‘bad’. The class exposed me to critical, academic, and analytical ways of thinking about films, which I found exceptionally interesting. Our analysis revolved around things like narrative structure, mise en scene (placement of characters/things within a scene), pacing, shot organization, etc. These are all aspects of any good film, however, there are plenty of bad films that nail these things. Many of the 'incredible' and 'genius' films we watched were boring slugfests that had us falling asleep during them. One was literally just a compilation of unstructured shots of Moscow during the Soviet Union. I can appreciate the academic value of watching and analyzing films like this, but frankly, I think a core component of movies that the class outright ignored is how entertaining they are.

            Even though I enjoyed the class, I couldn’t get over that glaring flaw in our analytical methodology. Instead of taking further classes offered by the department, some friends that took a separate introductory Film and Media Studies course and I decided to start a weekly movie night. Every Friday, we all get together, take edibles/smoke some weed, and watch 2-3 movies selected by us as a group. As a result of us having similar taste and interest in films, we discuss what movies will be watched throughout the week and settle on a couple. These films are usually related in some capacity, be them sequels/prequels of one another or via genre or theme.

            Why watch the films high? Well, being high only elevates one’s viewing experience. Speaking from experience, it rarely hinders my ability to comprehend/understand a film. Instead, I feel more connected to the film. I become more engaged, more empathetic with the characters, I pay more attention to the dialogue, I notice the details of each prop, shot, character, and environment. As a result, watching films high allows me to not only enjoy them more, but also to more thoughtfully and critically analyze them.

            The things I look at when reviewing a film are: dialogue, acting, narrative structure, cinematography, and overall entertainment/engagement. I have no particular methodology, although I will say that my scoring scale is heavily inspired by Dave Portnoy’s Pizza Reviews, which is a 0-10 decimal scale.
