    "name": "The Batman (2022)",
    "rating": "8.8",
    "review": "This movie hits the mark with great cinematography, impressive acting, and strong dialogue, presenting a new twist on a well-known character. The cinematography is top-tier, with tight-focus shots that highlight the fine details of costumes, props, and scenes. The narrative keeps you engaged with its unpredictability, weaving a story that surprises yet remains completely coherent. Robert Pattinson does a great job as Batman, but it's Colin Farrell as the Penguin and Paul Dano as the Riddler who really stand out. Farrell's Penguin is intimidating, witty, and shady, fitting perfectly into the movie's dark and gritty atmosphere. Dano's Riddler is creepy, complex, and broken, making him one of the most unforgettable villains in recent memory. The film's interpretation of Batman is, in my opinion, the best we've seen so far in Batman films, capturing the essence of the comic book hero as a solitary figure, a master detective, and someone deeply affected by his parents' death. This approach lets us see Batman's struggle with his demanding lifestyle, his gradual trust in others, and his confrontations with a series of dark and dangerous foes."
