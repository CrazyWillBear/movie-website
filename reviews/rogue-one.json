    "name": "Rogue One",
    "rating": "8.5",
    "review": "Rogue One feels more like a war film than a Star Wars movie, and that's not a bad thing. We see complex characters in situations reminiscent of actual wars throughout history, in planets/cities clearly inspired by places here on Earth. The acting is outstanding, connecting the audience on an intimate level with the characters. We feel the full scope of trauma, pain, regret, and suffering that the characters experience. Despite taking place in the Star Wars universe, this film hits close to home with its emotionally distressing scenes and storyline. This film also features incredible cinematography and VFX, making it a visual masterpiece on top of everything else.'"
