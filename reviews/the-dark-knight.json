    "name": "The Dark Knight",
    "rating": "8.7",
    "review": "This film is not amazing soley due to its incredible VFX, interesting storyline, and creative character dynamics. This film is made truly incredible by Heath Ledger's performance as joker. His performance is, in my opinion, the greatest acting performance of all time. Never have I seen an actor truly take on their character like Heath does in this film. His portrayal is borderline disturbing, and in fact, many attribute his death to the mental toll the role took due to his extreme method acting. No one will deny, however, that his dedication resulted in an incredible performance. This film is an absolute must-see."
