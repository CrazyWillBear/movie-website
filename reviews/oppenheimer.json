    "name": "Oppenheimer",
    "rating": "9.4",
    "review": "Oppenheimer is by far the best movie I've ever seen. The acting in this film is about as good as it gets, with Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, and many other actors putting on performances that rival some of their most famous works. The dialogue is incredible, perfectly expressing the complexity and conveying the emotions of each character. All of this is elevated by the film's outstanding VFX, which are of course practical and not CGI. As a result, throughout the film I found myself furious, intrigued, astonished, disgusted, and at times emotional. Christopher Nolan was already my favorite director; now I think he's the greatest of all time."
