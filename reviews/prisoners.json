    "name": "Prisoners",
    "rating": "8.6",
    "review": "This is simply a great film. With fantastic cinematography, a gripping story and incredible acting, Prisoners has it all. The film's many red herrings, plot twists, and otherwise unexpected moments had me thoroughly engaged the entire time. Combined with the convincing and moving acting by the entire cast, the grey-ish gloomy setting, and the complex mental states of the characters, this is a film that will have you thinking about it for days after you watch it."
