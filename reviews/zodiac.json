    "rating": "8",
    "review": "Zodiac is an all-around very good film. The cinematography in the film is great, but the best part of this movie is the acting. Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, and Mark Ruffalo put on fantastic performances, with Mark Ruffalo's being the best in my opinion. The dialogue is okay, not great, often coming across as cheesey and unrealistic. The storyline itself is interesting, although the ending feels rushed and ends up framing Arthur Leigh Allen as having been the Zodiac, when in fact, he likely wasn't. All in all, the film is very good, but it feels like it didn't reach its full potential."
