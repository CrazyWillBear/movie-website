    "name": "The Silence of the Lambs",
    "rating": "8.6",
    "review": "The Silence of the Lambs is an incredible film. Hannibal Lecter is a scary and complex villain, perfect for a plot with as many twists and turns as the film features. On top of a well written story and character, Anthony Hopkins's performance as Hannibal is legendary, as he captures in full the apathy and terrifying genius of his character. A classic for a reason, this film definitely deserves to be watched."
