    "name": "Project X",
    "rating": "6.9",
    "review": "Although it uses the 'your parents are out of town let's throw a party' trope, this film manages to be hilarious, terrifying, and creative. From the very beginning, the whole thing is being filmed by a fellow student on, I assume, a phone. This unique approach to the storytelling and cinematography is what makes the film so funny and scary, because it makes it look real. The cherry on top is the film's soundtrack, which is full of loud and obnoxious rap songs. Overall, this film isn't anything close to a masterpiece, but I'd say it's worth a watch just because of how funny it is."
