    "name": "Star Wars Ep. 3: Revenge of the Sith",
    "rating": "7.2",
    "review": "This movie is much better than its two predeccesors, and serves as a solid backbone for the remaining Star Wars movies. The fight choreography is outstanding, the VFX are solid, and the soundtrack is absolutely incredible. The things holding this film back are dialogue -- which is frankly terrible -- and a host of one-dimensional characters."
