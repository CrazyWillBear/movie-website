    "name": "Star Wars Ep. 9: The Rise of Skywalker",
    "rating": "5.3",
    "review": "As a standalone movie, it's perfectly fine. Solid acting, VFX, storyline, etc. However, as a Star Wars movie, it's not good at all. It undermines too many aspects of the previous movies, it's super cheesey, and it's lazily written (Palpatine coming back and dying to his own lightning for a THIRD time, Han Solo having force abilities, Rey becoming a Skywalker, etc)."
