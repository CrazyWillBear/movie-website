    "name": "The Conjuring",
    "rating": "6.7",
    "review": "The spooky setting, relatable characters, and quality VFX all add to the scariness of this already quite horrifying 'true' story. However, the film follows plenty of horror tropes and is very stereotypical for a modern horror film. Overall, this film isn't a must-watch, but if you find yourself doing so, get ready to be terrified."
